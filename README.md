# ScalaCollider Template App

## statement

This is a template to make a [ScalaCollider](https://github.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider) based application.
It assumes that SuperCollider (scsynth) is
independently installed on the system.

Note that ScalaCollider is published under the GNU General Public License v2 (or newer, at your choice),
so this applies to your project as well.

Simply open `MyScalaColliderApp.scala` and add your own code.

To run via sbt, simply execute `sbt run`. To build a standalone application, run `sbt assembly`.
The resulting jar can be executed via `java -jar MyScalaColliderApp.jar`.
